                  <h1>FAQ</h1>
                  <p>
                    I collected here the most common questions from recruiters:

                  </p>
                  <h3>Tell me about yourself and your background</h3>

                  <p>
                  I studied design and HR. I am involved with the web design since 1997 and working professionally since 2004. I designed my first web in 2001 (for a rock band) and my first mobile app in 2009 (for JWT).
                  Working for Globant I had the chance to learn while working for the greatest companies on earth (like <a href="https://www.globant.com/clients">Google, Expedia, Lastminute, Sabre, PWC, JWT and many more</a>)
                  Since then I never stopped learning because this world <a href="https://twitter.com/ValaAfshar/status/926120278664667142">is constantly changing.</a>
                  Worked for startups, big corportations in B2C and B2B products.
                  Started my career as web designer then became visual designer, consultant
                  UX designer, product designer and head of product.
                  </p>

                  <h3>What are you currently working on?</h3>

                  <p>
                    I am currently working for <a href="https://headbox.com">HeadBox</a>. HeadBox is the fastest growing Event Tech brand in the UK, on a mission to reinvent the global events industry through technology. We build human-kind event tech that turns our clients into superheroes. So whether you are a booker, a business or a venue you can unlock brilliant events with HeadBox.

                  </p>

                  <h3>Why do you want a change?</h3>
                  <p>
                  Many reasons: HeadBox is an agency with a very small product team. When I started I was told that they were an tech company with a big product team.
                  The Head of Product who hired me was fired a month after I joined, also one of the PMs.
                  They make too many decisions (mostly all) based on "we promised this to investors", so were little room for the product team to influence.
                  I find the world the events industry a bit shallow. We are not tackling this industry biggest problems.
                  </p>

                  <h3>What are you looking for your next role?</h3>
                  <p>
                  A company that's mature enough to understand and value the product design role and the customer centric approach to problem solving.
                  I'd like to continue developing as a designer and manager,
                  to mentor others and bring a good UX culture into companies. Own a product end to end (or parts of it) and being responsible for my decisions. To work in multidisciplinary diverse teams.
                  A company flexible to understand I have one year old son that
                  sometimes requires my full attention (I currently leave him 8 am in the morning at the nursery and have to pick him up 5:45 pm the latest, at least 3 times a week).
                  </p>

                  <h3>Are you interested in any industry in particular?</h3>
                  <p>DEPENDS. An example: I like fintech companies, but I don't like lending companies. I like B2C apps, but I don't like Revolut.
                    I like healthcare, but some might need a previous experience in that industry. Depends.
                  </p>


                  <h3>What areas of design you think you excel in?</h3>
                  <p>
                  Research, rapid prototyping, testing and visual design. I enjoy illustrating and motion design. I also code a little bit and use daily most new design software.
                  Scaling-up design, mentoring, working closely with developers.
                  </p>

                  <h3>What you think you not so good at?</h3>
                  <p>
                  I am a Product Designer/UX designer, not a UX researcher. I can do many types of research, but if you are looking for deep ethnographic studies you should try hiring anthropologist. UX stole many techniques from anthropology, but anthropologist are better a it.
                  </p>


                <h3>What you don't like?</h3>
                  <p>
                 When there's no collaboration between teams, when designer work in a silo.
                  Companies that don't value the importance of personal/family time.
                  Companies that don't know what problems are they solving or companies that don't talk to their customers.
                  I don't like to work for agencies or consultancy firms, I did my bit in the past.
                  </p>

<h3>Some of the tools I use in my work</h3>
<p>After effects, Illustrator, Sketch, Figma, html+css+js, Zeplin, Invision, Principle, Balsamiq, Whimsical, Notion, whiteboard, pen, paper & post-its.</p>


                  <h3>What makes you tick?</h3>
                  <p>
                To play with my son and watch him grow, to read a great book, to travel, learn a new skill. Music is a big inspiration for everything I do.
                To solve problems that are causing pain to people. To make people life easier is my ultimate goal.

                        <h3>Are you looking for permanent roles or as contractor?</h3>
                        <p>
                        In the short term it could be contractor but in a big company, long term, permanent.
                        </p>
                          <h3>What's your notice period?</h3>
                          <p>
                        1 Month.
                          </p>
                          <h3>You are argentinian, do you need a Visa?</h3>
                          <p>
                            I have been granted Indefinite leave to remain in the UK. I just need my future employer email to send proof <a href="https://right-to-work.service.gov.uk/eua/share-email">https://right-to-work.service.gov.uk/eua/share-email</a>
                          </p>

                          <h3>Where are you based?</h3>
                          <p>
                            In front of Elephant and Castle station
                          </p>

                          <h3>Salary expectations?</h3>
                          <p>
                            Perm 65-90k depending on resposibilities. Contractor 400-600 p/d. I am flexible, depending on the project and company.
                          </p>
