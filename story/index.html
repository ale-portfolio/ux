                  <h1>Let me tell you a story...</h1>
                  <p>
                     2018-2019, London.
                  </p>
                  <h3>What's HeadBox?</h3>
                  <p>HeadBox is an events agency with a digital marketplace that connects people organising events with venues. The proposition is quite simple, guests send briefs
                     to venues and venues respond them. Our agents provide a concierge service to our corporate accounts.
                  </p>

                  <h3>HeadBox before the new product team joined</h3>
                  <p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Data is all over the place and hard to make sense of it</li>
                     <li>The product was designed in isolation of customer insights.</li>
                     <li>   A Head of Product and a freelance designer designed</li>
                  the whole product in a silo to then give a long list of specifications to a remote developement agency to deliver code.</li>
                     <li> This resulted in a marketplace with a <em>1%</em> conversion rate, a funnel leaking <em>90%</em> of their users before their first call to action,
                        and a failed CRM that no one wants to use. Head of Product, designer and one PM were fired :(
                     </li>
                     <li>A business model based on commission does not help any of the parties involved
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  </p>

                  <h3>HeadBox day two.</h3>
                  <p>
                     A product manager assigns a task to me:
                  </p>
                  <img src="img/filter.png"></br>
                  <p>
                     PM: I need you to fix the filters</br>
                     ME: What's wrong with them?</br>
                     PM: We are not sure</br>
                     ME: Who are the people we are designing for?</br>
                     PM: Guests?</br>
                     PM: But... who are this people?</br>
                     PM: Not sure...</br>
                     ME: How is this helping or not helping people?</br>
                     PM: ...</br>
                     ME: Do we have any data about usage?</br>
                     PM: Not really?</br>
                     ME: How will this affect in the picture of problems we have? Is this really our biggest priority? Why?</br>
                     PM: Not sure :(</br>
                     ME: Have you seen anyone interacting with this?</br>
                     PM: No :(</br>
                     ME: Is there any diagram I can see to understand how this is connected to the other products?</br>
                     PM: No :(</br>
                     My confidence to make any good decision was close to zero.
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <h3>Communicating insights</h3>
                  <p>HeadBox team composition is mostly 90% sales with an average age of 23 years old. In the beginning we struggled to get people interested in our insights..</p>

                  <h3>Things that worked:</h3>

                  <p>A weekly email with bad news based in data insights but with a joyful tone</p>
                    <img src="img/email.png"></br>
                  <p>Inviting everyone to customer interviews and workshops</p>

                  <img loading="lazy" src="img/interview.jpg" />

                  <p>Research synthesis in funny videos</p>
                  <iframe loading="lazy" width="1120" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DScoJ0M0v2I" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe loading="lazy">
                  <iframe loading="lazy" width="1120" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xjuxgdU4WuE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe loading="lazy"></br>
                    <p> All this helped creating a shared understading about the big problems we had to tackle, to priortise and educate on how products can we built using insights from
                      data and customer interviews
                    </p>

                  <p>

                    <h3>The big problems identified</h3>
                    <p> After analysing opportunities and prioritising, we decided to tackle the following problems</p>
                  <ul class="problems">

                     <li>Venues not being able to manage their own listings</li>
                     <li>Guests not being able to find a venue and sending briefs to a support email</li>
                     <li>Guests don't really know what they want and they are overwhelwed by the amount of options</li>
                     <li>Multiple opportunities in the journey to cut out the marketplace</li/>
                     <li>The effort put into converting small meeting rooms causes losses</li>
                     <li>Venues wanting more events from us but at the same time not wanting to be spammed with irrelevant events</li>
                     <li>A 1% conversion rate and and drop of 90% in the funnel before the main call to action</li>
                  </ul>
                  </p>
                  <h3>The picture from data</h3>
                    <img loading="lazy" src="img/opp.png" />
                  <h3>How did we tackle this?</h3>
                  <p>
                    As shown previously we mapped current flows and their weaknesses and we created new ones validated by insights from data and customers.
                  </p>
                  <p> Here there is one example of the interviews:<p>

                </p>
                                    <iframe loading="lazy" width="1120" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nb9XqJQ1wow" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe loading="lazy">
                  <p>
                  <p> Loads of whiteboarding, data studios, sketching </p>

                    <img loading="lazy" src="img/wires.jpg" />

                    <p> We narrowed down to few potentially winning prototypes and show them to customers.</p>

            <img loading="lazy" src="img/new.png" />
                  <p>The new HeadBox will allow guests to send their brief as detailed as they need but not more than that, will allow venues to easily list and find new business without spam</p>
