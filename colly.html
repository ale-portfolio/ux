                  <h3>The problem</h3>
                  <p>
                  Vietnam has a population of 90m, up to 90% of transactions are cash-based.
                  A major use case for bank cards is cash out from ATM, E-commerce payments are cash on delivery.
                  Only 1 in 10 have heard about Mobile wallets and merely 3% have ever used one.
                  This project was also motivated by the team members who wanted to learn how to build apps using React in a
                  very short period of time.
                  </p>


  <h3>What it does</h3>


                  <p>
                    For small (street) merchants in Vietnam who need to manage financial flows, Colly is a mobile wallet solution that makes it very easy to accept digital payments.
                    Unlike cash payments, it automatically keeps records thus catering for financial inclusion (bank loans etc.). It also allows end-customers to send money (P2P) free of charge.
 </p>


                  <h3>What I've done</h3>
                                  <p>
This was mainly a UI job, most of the research was done by an external team of researchers from a Vietnamese university.
I created sketches, user flows and several clickable prototypes that were tested with Vietnamese customers.
I received requirements and provided the UI needed for the Beta app. We will run
a pilot to validate some assumptions and to learn more about merchants and customers.
It was a very pragmatic, agile and simple approach and at the same time very challenging due to the language and the very little amount
of time we had to work on this.
   </p>

   <p>The Android and the iOS app allowed people to top-up, withdraw, send and receive money while providing identity verification. </p>
