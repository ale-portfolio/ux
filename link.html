                  <h1>Linkage Southwark</h1>
                  <p>
                    2017, United Kingdom.  <a href="hhttp://linkagesouthwark.org/">Linkage Southwark</a>
                  </p>
                  <h2>A simple solution for a complex problem</h2>
                  <h3>The problem</h3>
                  <p>
            Linkage Southwark is a charity with a limited budget. They connect volunteers with older people that need help with odd jobs. The government provided them with a <a href="http://www.lamplightdb.co.uk/">software</a>, but is was not useful to them and they were seeking for help to build a more bespoke tool that actually solved the problem they had. Our developers were busy at the moment so I knew I was not going to be able to develop anything for them but maybe
            I was still going to be able to help. Matching people and coordinating was a hassle.
                  </p>
  <h3>How did I do it</h3>


                  <p>
I knew nothing about volunteers so I when to a few meetups with them to understand how they usually work and what are the things that bothers and annoy them the most. I also interviewed leaders of other volunteer's groups (not Linkage) to understand how they solved the problem and "Whatsapp" seemed to be a common solution. To learn more about the problem I asked the software operators (two Linkage employees) to create a document were they had to write all the steps to book an odd job and to annotate where in those steps they were feeling the most frustrated. After completing this document I interviewed them to know more details about their daily job.
                I had 3 different customers: old people, volunteers and linkage operators. So I created personas to map their different needs and goals. </p>


                  <h3>What I learned</h3>
                                  <p>
I learned that they were using only a tiny part of the software provided by the government. Also I learned that there was a lot of offline work, calls to volunteers and things written in paper that were not registered and created a bit chaos between the two employees (like duplicated calls to volunteers) and also were not able to report any of this to their management. I learned that I was able to use SMS and even Whatsapp with the volunteers and also with some of the older people.
                     </p>

                  <h3>How did I solve it</h3>
                                  <p>They needed a tool to communicate with groups and individuals, they needed to create different kind of groups, they needed to have a record of the conversations and they needed to be easy to use and as convenient as a phone call.
Instead of building a prototype, I donated a smartphone and based on the previous learnings I created a protocol for a booking using the smartphone exclusive. I asked them to them to test it for a few weeks and to annotate in a doc if they found any "issues". They choose their more prolific volunteers and I created a Whatsapp account to connect with them. In that way they were able to easily connect with volunteers, they were able to share it between the two employees and also every chat was registered, so there was no place for duplicated calls.


                                    <h3>Results</h3>
                                                    <p>
                                                      After the final test it was very clear the type of system they needed  and everyone involved found it very convenient and useful, the "issues" document was empty. So I helped them creating requirements so they could send to their development team to create a more useful tool for them.
  They continued using the smartphone for a while and added “Mobile phone” to their <a href="http://linkagesouthwark.org/volunteer-with-us/">volunteers on-boarding form</a>. They not only gained in transparency and convenience, they also started saving money and time because of the reduction in the number of phone calls.
