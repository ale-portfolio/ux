                    2013-2016, United Kingdom and Germany. <a href="http://payfriendz.com">Payfriendz</a>

                  </p>

<h3>What's Payfriendz</h3>
<p>Payfriendz was an Android and iOs payment app giving people an easy and secure way to send or request money in real-time.

<h3>Why did I join?</h3>

                  <p>
                    In 2013 I was contacted by Payfriendz’s CTO to help them with a new product they were planning to launch in the UK.
                     He needed help in understanding their potential customers and creating the brand's visual style. They already spent time and budget building a product and he needed to learn if it was usable and useful to their potential customers.
                  In the beginning, I worked as an external consultant and later in the project as the lead product designer.
</p>


<h3>Tech Stack</h3>
  <p>React, meteor, ruby and native iOs and Android apps. Agile development with a mix of local and remote teams.</p>

<p>The app worked in Android and iOs. It was built Initially in Ruby Motion and then Meteor. I had to design a UI component system that
  worked well for both Android and iOs while being built mostly html+css. I worked closely with a team of 2 designers and 15 engineers working remotely
  and locally.
<h3>Many hats</h3>
<p>
  During my time at Payfriendz, a small startup, I had to wear many hats: I mentored customer support employees that later became junior UX researchers,
  I created promotional videos, posters, hundreds of UI iterations for and Android and iOs app, style guides, learn about meteor framework, react native, coded, worked with waterfall, kanban, agile methodologies, designed a dashboard, email marketing campaigns, landing pages, managed junior designers, trained video editors and more things. It was a great
  learning experience.
