<p>

                  <em>  You are an owner-tenant and your needs are:
                    Maintain the property, as and when something happens</em>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Report maintenance issues and minor repairs
                    <li>See major events and maintenance history
  </ul>
                    <em>   Pay my rent every month</em>
  <ul>
                  <li> How to display my next payment due and previous payments
                  <li>When will my rent increase and by how much (yearly at the rate of inflation)
  </ul>
                    <em>   Increase my ownership regularly</em>
  <ul>
              <li> The current ownership level (Starts with a minimum of 5%)
                  <li>Property valuation (4 times a year) and its history
                <li> If I want to make one-off staircasing payment or arrange regular staircasing payment
  </ul>

</p>

  <h3>What it does</h3>


                  <p>

  Tools used
Pen paper, Invision (interactive prototype), Balsamiq (low res prototype), Lucidchart (user flows), Html, Atomic design (UI)

                                    I have to make certain assumptions because I don’t have enough data from customers yet.

<h3> Basic architecture and user flows</h3>
<p>
  Based on the information provided. Tried a few things:
In the beginning I grouped the main tasks as Activity / Payments / Maintenance because both rent and ownership have a “Payment” component after further consideration
I ended grouping main tasks as <em>Rent / Ownership / Maintenance</em>. This prevents confusion around what I am paying (ownership or rent?). I believe it aligns better with the company message.
 It could be validated with a simple card sorting exercise if necessary.

<h3>Maintain the property, as and when something happens</h3>

<p>
  I assumed, because I owned just a little portion, that Unmortgage was going to pay the cost, find a repair service and that’s why they need me to report it.
</p>
  <em>Actor</em><p>
  Martha & Robert
</p>

  <em>Scenario</em><p>
  The chain of the blackout is broken and needs replacement. It’s not easy to change so we have to call a service to repair it.
</p>

  <em>Basic flow</em><p>
  Create a report > Confirmation of reception from Unmortgage > Repair or issue is shown in history marked as OPEN or IN PROGRESS > Service comes and repairs > Repair is shown as COMPLETED.
</p>
  When I build UI I always try to think how it is going to be coded. An easy way to do this is using atomic design (atoms, molecules, templates , pages). Is a good way to think a bit like a developer and create modularised components that can be re-used, I also consider different states (empty, loading, error, full, partial, I tend to start with a full or partial first).
  I follow good design principles, common patterns, platform guidelines and usability principles.

<h3>Pay rent</h3>
<em>Actor</em>
<p>Martha & Robert</p>

<em>Scenario</em>
<p>End of the month, Lorena changed her job recently. Salary still not deposited and they want to know how much and when the rent is due.
</p>
<em>Basic flow</em>
<p>Rent>  Next payment > See amount and date
</p>
<p>A calculation of how rent will be reduced in case of increasing ownership could be shown also in the future rent section</p>
<p>Also a graphic could be shown to represent the evolution of your rent in time or just simply show the future value predictions</p>
