                  <p>
                    Disclaimer:
                    During my career, I designed for multiple companies using diverse platforms, technologies, worked with different types of teams in a different type of roles.
                    Some of my work could look a bit dated or maybe it does not exist anymore, that's due to the fast pace of technology. It was a long journey and I learned a lot in every step.
                  </p>

                  <h2>2008-2012</h2>
                  <p>Historic context: Obama was winning his election and I was...coding and designing websites, landing pages and apps for <a href="https://www.globant.com/">Globant</a>.
                    Facebook was still not very popular worldwide and practically non-existent in  America. The Iphone was just launched a year ago
                    and we had only two devices to share in a company of 1000+ employees. UX was not a thing, flat design was not a thing, designers working in software development were mere decorators. Skeuomorphism was the trend and we were (wrongly) using the only tools available
                     like Tortoise git, Photoshop and html+css+js to collaborate between designers and developers.
                  </p>
                  <p>It's hard to rescue something decent from ten years ago, I have loads of lost work protected by NDAs or simply just lost in time.
                    Here you can find some examples like internal tools for Globant, contract work for Travelocity or CDR and a social network I designed an coded for <a href="https://www.telefonica.com/en/">Telefonica</a>.
                  Also some personal projects.</p>
