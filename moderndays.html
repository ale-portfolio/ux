                  <h1>UI work, modern days</h1>


                  <h2>2012-2018</h2>
                  <p>Historic context: Trump is president, we have Brexit and I am...designing products and managing teams & projects for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/s93/">S93</a>.
                    A very questioned Facebook is the most popular company worldwide (with Whatsapp and Instagram ). The Iphone is more powerful than any supercomputer I used in 2008, we interact with many AI and devices,
                    technology is an essential part of everyone's lives. UX design is an essential part of most companies and sometimes the only differentiator and there's a sea of
                    design tools that is hard to keep up.

                  </p>
                  <p> In the last 6 years, I worked mainly for financial products. Designed dashboards, internal tools, native mobile apps in different roles from
                    consultant to lead designer to head of product.
                    I can only show a few examples, again, some stuff was lost, some is offline or look dated. Technology keeps progressing at a fast pace.
                  </p>

                  <div>
                    <h3>Keymono</h3>
                    <p>Keymono was a mobile app that allowed you to easily collect and pay debts using links. I designed the whole UX/UI experience. It was used to show
                      our API and platform capabilities.

                    </p>

               </div>

               <div>
                 <h3>CUVVA</h3>
                 <p>CUVVA is a pay-as-you-go modern insurance. I created a few concepts for their new app to kickstart their creativity.

                 </p>
                     <img loading="lazy" src="img/cuvva.jpg" alt="UI during 2018"/>
                 </p>

            </div>

            <div>
              <h3>Payfriendz</h3>
              <p>Way before the Monzos and Starlings I designed the end to end experience for Payfriendz, a crazy concept a mix of chat and payments, maybe too ahead of its time. In a span of 3 years the app had many versions and ran on different technologies, native, Ruby motion, Meteor and React, all very challenging to design for.
                During this time I designed fraud detection dashboards, migration tools, internal tools, landing pages, ads, a design system, mobile apps, games and promotional videos. Fun times.

         <div>
           <h3>Nomo</h3>
           <p>Dashboard for a B2B payment solution.

      </div>

         <div>
           <h3>Landing pages</h3>
           <p>During this period I designed hundreds of landing pages for products, MPV validation and promotions.

           <h2>Motion design</h2>
           <p>I love motion design, my favourite tools are After Effects and CSS animation. I also use Principle and Invision for rapid prototyping. Here some random
           funny examples.</p>
