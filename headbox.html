                  <p>
                    2018-2019, London.

                  </p>


                  <h3>The problem</h3>
                  <p>
                    When I started Jan 2019 HeadBox was going through an internal transformation period: almost an entirely new product team was joining: The new Head of Product, the new head of engineering, the new design team.</br>

                    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/headboxspaces/photos/today-we-have-announced-the-launch-of-stack-our-brand-new-venue-booking-software/1002131416612600/">  A few products were launched before I joined</a> the roadmap for the next quarter was defined. The company was launching <a href="https://www.conference-news.co.uk/news/event-tech-start-headbox-expands-ireland"> internationally</a>
                  </br>There was no way to gather data about performance to make any kind of decision. Most development was made using waterfall methodology with an external team. They knew very little about their customers, the product was built in a vacuum and isolation of customer feedback and their latest product launch flopped. There was no customer support, people had to find a hidden email to ask for help.

                  </p>

    <h3>Tech Stack</h3>
    <p>React, mobile web and desktop. Kanban development with a mix of local and remote teams.</p>

  <h3>The impact of the new team</h3>


                  <p>
                    The new teams were conformed by one product designer, one product manager and 2-3 developers. 3 designers joined and 2 new product managers.

                  </p>


                  <h3>What we learned</h3>
                                  <p>
The first thing we did was to start gathering knowledge internally and externally about customer problems. We interviewed 15 customers to understand their goals and problems.
</p>

<p>We brought people from different departments into customer interviews and workshops and that help to create a common understanding of customer problems. The outcome of this first round of research: we identified inefficient processes, needs, motivation and problems</p>

<p>Two quick funny summaries can be seen in the following examples</p>

</p>
<h3>Some of the big problems we had to tackle</h3>

<p>
<ul class="problems">
    <li>A model that has been failing <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vu0wnfrdbka2hrl/Speakeasy%20post%20mortem.pdf?dl=0">for a while.</a></li>
  <li>Venues not being able to manage their listings.</li>
  <li>Guest enquiries not being responded.</li>
  <li>Guests not being able to find a venue.</li>
  <li>Venues being spammed by marketplaces emails.</li>
  <li>Funnel not being easy to track.</li>
  <li>Guest and host "crime".</li>
  <li>Products not making any profit.</li>

</ul>
</p>

                  <h3>How did we tackle this?</h3>
                                  <p>
                                    Great teamwork. We mapped current processes and created new flows based on our research learnings. <a href="https://whimsical.com/Jbm3wC6cNMnzC8hqxLfrX5#2Ux7TurymQfUTKnLn6Uw">You can see them here</a></p>

<p>
We ran workshops to gather knowledge and find solutions. We created prototypes and show them to customers.
Here are some examples of the interviews:
