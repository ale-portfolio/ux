                  <h2>What to do with your used baby clothes</h2>
                  <h3>The problem</h3>
                  <p>
            Babies grow fast and parents usually end up with a lot used (and unused) baby clothes. To add to the problem most people without kids don't
              know who to buy clothes for babies so they buy the wrong sizes. Most parents end up with tons of same the size/type of clothes that
              might never use. A mom approached us with an app that was made during a hackathon to validate if that was the best way to solve this issue.
            </table>

                  </p>
  <h3>How did I do it</h3>


                  <p>
First thing I did was to do a heuristic review of the app. The app basically allowed you to input your baby's age and size and it will calculate the future
sizes. It will also allow you to share that information on Facebook.
Initially, with my little knowledge about the subject, it sounded like a great idea but I needed to talk to some parents first. So I organised several sessions with parents to learn more about the
issue. The main goal was to understand their current issues around baby clothing. I also organised usability testing sessions
to see the parents interacting with the app.
 </p>

                  <h3>What I learned</h3>
                                  <p>
                                    Parents did not like the idea of sharing on Facebook due to privacy concerns.
                                    Parents had big problems storing all the unused clothes and they tried selling without success because "most sites were not made for that".
                                    All brands have a different type of sizes, so the app could not serve them all.
                                    They installed many apps for babies but did not pay for any of them because they were not useful. Parents usually trusted other parents advice.
                                    Apart from solving a few usability issues, the main learning was that it was the wrong app for the app to solve the problem.
                                    Parents needed a dedicated store where they could sell, swap or give away all the baby stuff they did not want anymore.

                     </p>



                  <h3>How did I solve it</h3>
                                  <p>
                                    I researched about easy to use and install online store solutions so we could test if a dedicated store was a better solution.
                                    I found Sharetribe, a platform that allows installing a fully functional marketplace in a few minutes.
                                    So we created the store and shared with parents.
                                  </p>


                                    <h3>Results</h3>
                                                    <p>
                                                      After testing the store for a few months the results were clear. Parents were uploading and selling their unused items online.
                                                      We installed and customised a new version of the store adding payments and other UI details. In its short time,
                                                      Mummybay is being used by hundreds of parents and a new store is set to open in other countries soon.
