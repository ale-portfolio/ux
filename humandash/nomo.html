                  <h1>Nomo (For NTT Docomo and Docomo Digital)</h1>
                  <p>
                    2016-2017, Europe and Asia.

                  </p>

                  <h2>A Smooth onboarding for developers.</h2>
                  <h3>The problem</h3>
                  <p>
                    In 2016 I joined Su4erheroes while they were building a product for one of their clients, Docomo Digital. The product was a payout solution
                    that included a dashboard, API docs and a mobile app. Main customers were internal OPs, Marketplaces OPS and developers in charge of integrating the API.
                    The main issue was that the developers integrating were based in different countries and the onboarding process was broken.
                    The perception was "Developer's are smart they'll figure it out"
                  </p>
  <h3>How did I do it</h3>


                  <p>
I asked for a Slack account to be created so I could interview and gather information regarding the onboarding issues. I also reviewed the analytics information
and mapped the current onboarding to understand what could be improved and to identify the paint points. I also created personas to identify all moving parts: operators, Nomo developers, customer's developers, owners.

                  </p>


                  <h3>What I learned</h3>
                                  <p>
I learned that sometimes the developer integrating were actually an external team hired by the marketplace owner and that was causing communication issues between all parties.
  I also learned that API documents were not regularly updated and sometimes the onboarding was completed via phone call or email threads making all the process not very efficient and scalable. Starting
  to integrate was considered messy.
Making Nomo more developer friendly was crucial for the future of the project because they were an important part of the new customer acquisition flow. I shared all the learnings with the team.
</p>


                  <h3>How did I solve it</h3>
                                  <p> With all the information gathered I created, in collaboration with Nomo's development team, we created an onboarding process document that allowed any developer starting to use Nomo in just
                                    3 simple steps.
                                    Also a dedicated person was hired to keep the documents up to date and some of Nomo's developers joined the Slack channel to provide a more personalised
                                    support for the developers integrating the API.
                                       </p>

                                    <h3>Results</h3>
                                                    <p>
                                                     Developer's perception changed about how easy was to start using and testing the API and the community created helped improving the API docs,
                                                     finding bugs and improving the product in general. Communication was centralised and the learnings were public for the benefits of future integrators.
